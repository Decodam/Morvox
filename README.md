# Morvox

Morvox is a mobile application designed to help speechless individuals communicate using Morse code. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Morvox simplifies the process of Morse code communication by providing an intuitive interface for entering and decoding Morse code messages.

## Features

- Enter text or Morse code using the on-screen keyboard
- Decode Morse code input into text
- Speech synthesis to vocalize Morse code messages
- Easy-to-use interface for smooth communication

## About Morse Code

Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs. It was invented by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the early 1830s. Morse code was widely used for early radio communication and is still used today in various applications, including amateur radio and aviation.

You can save this content in a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project. Additionally, you'll need to create a `Morse_Code_Table.md` file containing the Morse code table and a `Distro` folder with the app distribution files. Adjust the content and links as needed based on your project structure and requirements.
