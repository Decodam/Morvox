Morvox
Morvox is an application designed to assist speechless individuals in communicating using Morse code. Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes. This app provides a user-friendly interface for inputting messages and translating them into Morse code, as well as decoding Morse code into text.

Features
Input text messages and translate them into Morse code.
Decode Morse code input into text messages.
Real-time translation and decoding.
Simple and intuitive user interface.
Supports basic functionality for communication using Morse code.

About Morse Code
Morse code is a method of transmitting text information by using sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, which can be used to represent text characters, numbers, and punctuation. Developed in the early 1830s and 1840s, it was widely used for early radio communication before the advent of voice transmission.
